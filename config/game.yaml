title: 'Azuristan and Crimsonia'
scenario: |
    Azuristan and Crimsonia are neighboring countries in Central Asia.  Azuristan is a Western-backed democracy that suffers from endemic corruption.  Crimsonia is controlled by an autocratic government that stifles dissent and commits human rights violations.
    
    Both countries have modern professional militaries, although Crimsonia's is slightly larger than Azuristan's.  In addition, Azuristan possesses ten nuclear weapons and Crimsonia has eight.
    
    Most citizens of Azuristan are from the Azuristani ethnic group, and most citizens of Crimsonia are from the Crimsonian ethnic group.  The only exception is Azuristan's province of Tyriana, on the border with Crimsonia.  Most residents of Tyriana belong to the Crimsonian ethnic group.
    The animosity between Azuristan and Crimsonia extends back over centuries of ethnic tension and intermittent warfare.  Recent years have been fairly calm.  However, that suddenly changes when Tyriana declares independence.  Amidst the crisis, local leaders in Tyriana ask Crimsonia to come to the province's defense, and the same leaders indicate that they want Tyriana to become part of Crimsonia.
